            <h3> An Enthusiast about Literature and Cultural Studies</h3>
            <p>Simply put, literature represents the culture and tradition of a language or a people. The concept is
                difficult to precisely define, though many have tried; it's clear that the accepted definition of
                literature is constantly changing and evolving. For many, the word literature suggests a higher artform;
                merely putting words on a page doesn't necessarily equate to creating literature. A canon is the
                accepted body of works for a given author. Some works of literature are considered canonical, that is,
                culturally representative of a particular genre (poetry, prose, or drama).</p>
